# UDACITY-PID-Control-of-an-autonomous-car
Programming a Udacity Autonomous car on C++ using PID control for moving on a Race track.

Inside the Main folder, there is a folder called src. This folder contains all the cpp files. 

The PID.cpp file is the main file that had to be modified by the student to implement the PID controller gains, and the PID error. 

The main.cpp was provided by Udacity, which implements the PID controller on the simulated car on a race track.
